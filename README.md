## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the **correlation between key factors in the movie industry** such as budget, revenue, IMDb ratings, and more. Using **Python**, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and insights.  

## 📂 Dataset  
📍 **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
📁 **Format**: CSV  
📊 **Contains**:  
- Movie titles, genres, and release years  
- Budget, revenue, and profitability  
- IMDb ratings and audience scores  

## 🎯 Objectives  
✅ Identify the key factors that influence **box office success**  
✅ Analyze **correlations** between budget, revenue, and ratings  
✅ Use **data visualization** for pattern recognition  
✅ Gain insights into **genre trends over time**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🔹 **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
🔹 **Libraries Used**:  
   - `pandas` 📊 (Data Handling)  
   - `numpy` 🔢 (Numerical Computations)  
   - `matplotlib` 📈 (Visualization)  
   - `seaborn` 🎨 (Advanced Graphs)  

## 📌 Notebook Breakdown  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** 🧹: Cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting  
2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Statistical summaries and distributions  
3️⃣ **Data Visualization** 📊: Correlation heatmaps, bar plots, and scatter plots  
4️⃣ **Key Findings** 💡: Insights on budget-revenue relationships and more  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** and the following libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
### Run the Notebook  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/momina02/movie-data-correlation.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Load the dataset and execute the notebook step by step 📖  

## 📊 Key Insights  
📌 **Higher budgets tend to lead to higher revenues, but with diminishing returns**  
📌 **Certain genres (e.g., Action, Adventure) consistently perform well at the box office**  
📌 **IMDb ratings have a weak correlation with revenue, showing that audience preference isn’t always driven by money**
